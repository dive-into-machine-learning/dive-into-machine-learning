Hi there! You might find this guide helpful if:

* You know Python or [you're](https://github.com/alexmojaki/futurecoder) [learning](https://nbviewer.org/github/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython/blob/master/Index.ipynb) [it](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python#resources) [:snake:](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#introduction-to-programming)
* You're new to [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)
* You care about [the ethics of ML](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-artificial-intelligence-guidelines)
  * **[8 Responsible Machine Learning Principles](https://ethical.institute/principles.html)**
  * [Open Ethics Canvas](https://openethics.ai/canvas/)
* You learn by doing

For some great alternatives, [jump to the end](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning#more-ways-to-dive-into-machine-learning) or [check out Nam Vu's guide, Machine Learning for Software Engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers).

Of course, there is no easy path to expertise. Also, _I'm not an expert!_ I just want to connect you with some great resources _from_ experts. Applications of ML are all around us. I think it's in the public interest for more people to learn more about ML, especially hands-on, because there are many different ways to learn.

Whatever motivates _you_ to dive into machine learning, if you know a bit of Python, these days you can get hands-on with a machine learning _"Hello World!"_ in minutes.

# Let's get started

## Tools you'll need

### If you prefer local installation

* [Python](https://www.python.org/). Python 3 is the best option.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). (Formerly known as IPython Notebook.)
* Some scientific computing packages:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib

You can install Python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities. (Use whichever tool works for you. [If you're unsure or need more context about using conda/virtualenv/poetry/pipenv, here's a very helpful guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20211226071314/https://brainsteam.co.uk/2021/04/01/opinionated-guide-to-virtualenvs/))

### Cloud-based options

Some options you can use from your browser:

- **[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is Jupyter Notebook's official choice to [try JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try)**
- [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/) allows for real-time collaboration
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) provides "free" GPUs

For other options, see:

- [markusschanta/awesome-jupyter, "Hosted Notebook Solutions"](https://github.com/markusschanta/awesome-jupyter#hosted-notebook-solutions)
- [ml-tooling/best-of-jupyter, "Notebook Environments"](https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-jupyter)

## Let's go!

**[Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) (5-10 minutes).** (You can [learn by screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb7FT68tcA8) instead.)

Now, follow along with this brief exercise: **[An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)**. Do it in `ipython` or a Jupyter Notebook, coding along and executing the code in a notebook.

[![I'll wait.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420688/29441281-00eff0c4-837f-11e7-9666-d653a1cd2372.jpeg)](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)

## What just happened?

You just classified some hand-written digits using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Neat huh?

# Dive in

## A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning

Let's learn a bit more about Machine Learning, and a couple of common ideas and concerns. Read ["A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1"](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) by [Stephanie Yee](https://twitter.com/stephaniejyee) and [Tony Chu](https://twitter.com/tonyhschu/).

[![A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning, Part 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2420688/29441234-a2028c98-837e-11e7-88f2-1ca5a94684f6.gif)](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)

It won't take long. It's a beautiful introduction ... Try not to drool too much!

## "A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning"

OK. Let's dive deeper.

Read **["A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning"](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)** by [Prof. Pedro Domingos](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/). It's densely packed with valuable information, but not opaque. (Don't worry if you don't understand it all yet.) Take some time with this one.

## Jargon note

* [What is the difference between Data Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Big Data?](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Data-Analytics-Data-Analysis-Data-Mining-Data-Science-Machine-Learning-and-Big-Data-1)
* Another handy term: ["Data Engineering."](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-does-a-data-engineer-do-and-how-do-i-become-one)
  * ["MLOps"](https://ml-ops.org/) overlaps with Data Eng, and there's [an introductory MLOps section later in this guide](#production-deployment-mlops).

# Immerse yourself

Pick one of the courses below and start on your way.

## [Prof. Andrew Ng's _Machine Learning_ on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

**[Prof. Andrew Ng's](https://hai.stanford.edu/people/andrew-ng) [_Machine Learning_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is a popular and esteemed free online course. I've seen it [recommended](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1/answer/Cory-Hicks-1) [often.](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1/answer/Xavier-Amatriain) [And emphatically.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2013/12/29/why-is-machine-learning-cs-229-the-most-popular-course-at-stanford/)**

It's recommended to grab a textbook to use as an in-depth reference. The two I saw recommended most often were _[Understanding Machine Learning](https://web.archive.org/web/20210717194345/http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/copy.html)_
and _[Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)_. [You only need to use one of the two options as your main reference; here's some context/comparison to help you pick which one is right for you.](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/29)

### Public datasets and pet projects

You might like to have a pet project to play with, on the side. When you are ready for that, you
could explore one of these: [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets), [paperswithcode.com/datasets](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets), [datasetlist.com](https://www.datasetlist.com/)

### Tips for this course

* [Study tips for Prof. Andrew Ng's course, by Ray Li](https://rayli.net/blog/data/coursera-machine-learning-review/)
* If you're wondering, _Is it still a relevant course?_ or trying to figure out if it fits for you personally, check out these reviews:
    * [Review: Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course](https://towardsdatascience.com/review-andrew-ngs-machine-learning-course-b905aafdb7d9)
    * [The user reviews on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/reviews)

### Tips for studying on a busy schedule

It's hard to make time available every week. So, you can try to study more _effectively_ within the time you have available. Here are some ways to do that:

* ["Learning How to Learn" by Barbara Oakley](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/) by Barbara Oakley, a free video course on Coursera.
* Prefer book/audiobook? These are great options:
  * [Barbara Oakley's book _A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science_](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers) ([reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers)) â€” "We all have what it takes to excel in areas that don't seem to come naturally to us at first"
  * [_Make It Stick: the Science of Successful Learning_](https://www.retrievalpractice.org/make-it-stick) ([reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18770267-make-it-stick))

### Take my tips with a grain of salt

I am not a machine learning expert. I'm just a software developer and these resources/tips were useful to me as I learned some ML on the side.

# Assorted Tips and Resources

## Risks - some starting points

"Machine learning systems automatically learn programs from data." Pedro Domingos, in ["A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning."](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf) The programs you generate will require maintenance. Like any way of creating programs faster, you can rack up [technical debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).

Here is the abstract of [Machine Learning: The High-Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt](https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/):

> Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.

If you're reading this guide, you should read that paper. You can also [listen to a podcast episode interviewing one of the authors of this paper](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2015/11/17/machine-learning-and-technical-debt-with-d-sculley/).

* **[Awesome Production Machine Learning](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning), "a curated list of awesome open source libraries to deploy, monitor, version and scale your machine learning."** It includes a section about [privacy-preserving ML](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning#privacy-preserving-machine-learning), by the way!

## Deep Learning

Take note: some experts warn us not to get too far ahead of ourselves, and encourage learning ML fundamentals before moving onto deep learning. That's paraphrasing from some of the linked coursework in this guide â€” for example, Prof. Andrew Ng encourages building foundations in ML before studying DL. Perhaps you're ready for that now, or perhaps you'd like to get started soon and learn some DL in parallel to your other ML learnings.

When you're ready to dive into Deep Learning, here are some helpful resources.

* **[_Dive into Deep Learning_](https://d2l.ai/) - An interactive book about deep learning** ([view on GitHub](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en))
  * Quickstart:
    * [Run this book locally, using Jupyter Notebooks](https://d2l.ai/chapter_installation/index.html)
    * [Run this book in your browser, using Google Colab](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-tools-for-deep-learning/colab.html)
  * "The entire book is drafted in Jupyter notebooks, seamlessly integrating exposition figures, math, and interactive examples with self-contained code." 
  * "You can modify the code and tune hyperparameters to get instant feedback to accumulate practical experiences in deep learning."

## Collaborate with Domain Experts

Machine Learning can be powerful, but it is not magic.

Whenever you apply Machine Learning to solve a problem, you are going to be working in some specific problem domain. To get good results, you or your team will need "substantive expertise" / "domain knowledge." Learn what you can, for yourself... But you should also **collaborate with experts.** You'll have better results if you collaborate with [subject-matter experts and domain experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert#Domain_expert_(software)).

### Machine Learning and User Experience (UX)

I couldn't say it better:

> **Machine learning wonâ€™t figure out what problems to solve.** If you arenâ€™t aligned with a human need, youâ€™re just going to build a very powerful system to address a very smallâ€”or perhaps nonexistentâ€”problem.

That quote is from ["The UX of AI" by Josh Lovejoy](https://design.google/library/ux-ai/). In other words, **[You Are Not The User](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/false-consensus/).** Suggested reading: [Martin Zinkevich's "Rules of ML Engineering", Rule #23: "You are not a typical end user"](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/#human_analysis_of_the_system)

What are some ways one can practice?

<details>
<summary><strong>One way:</strong> competitions and challenges</summary>

You need **practice.** [On Hacker News, user olympus commented to say you could use competitions to practice and evaluate yourself](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10508565). [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) and [ChaLearn](http://www.chalearn.org/) are hubs for Machine Learning competitions. (You can find more competitions [here](https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code#results-leaderboards) or [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/12-data-science-ai-competitions-to-advance-your-skills-in-2021-32e3fcb95d8c).)

You also need **understanding.** You should review what Kaggle competition winners say about their solutions, [for example, the "No Free Hunch" blog](http://blog.kaggle.com/). These might be over your head at first but once you're starting to understand and appreciate these, you know you're getting somewhere.

Competitions and challenges are just one way to practice! [Machine Learning isn't just about Kaggle competitions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/19/machine-learning-isnt-kaggle-competitions).

<summary><strong>Another way:</strong> try doing some practice studies</summary>

Here's a complementary way to practice: **do practice studies.**

1. **Ask a question. Start exploring some data.** The ["most important thing in data science is the question"](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/blob/master/01_DataScientistToolbox/03_02_whatIsData/index.Rmd#the-data-is-the-second-most-important-thing) ([Dr. Jeff T. Leek](https://github.com/jtleek)). So start with a question. Then, find [real data](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets). Analyze it. Then ...
2. **Communicate results.** When you think you have a novel finding, ask for review. When you're still learning, ask in informal communities (some are [linked below](#some-communities-to-know-about)).
3. **Learn from feedback.** Consider [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), it works great for some folks. (Don't pressure yourself yet though! Everybody is different, and it's good to know your learning style.)

How can you come up with interesting questions? Here's one way. Pick a day each week to [look for public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) and write down some questions that come to mind. Also, sign up for [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), a newsletter of interesting datasets. When a question inspires you, try exploring it with the skills you're learning.

This advice, to do practice studies and learn from review, is based on [a conversation](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-153934120) with [Dr. Randal S. Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/). Here's more advice from Olson, [quoted with permission:](https://github.com/hangtwenty/dive-into-machine-learning/issues/11#issuecomment-154135498)

> I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part of being an expert is knowing that there's rarely a clear answer, especially when you're working with real data.

As you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more scientific, interesting, and focused. Also, [here's a video about the scientific method in data science.](https://101.datascience.community/2012/06/27/the-data-scientific-method/))

### Aside: Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning

From [the "Bayesian Machine Learning" overview on Metacademy](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/bayesian_machine_learning):

> ... Bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the past 20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in building structured models of real world phenomena. Algorithmic advances and increasing computational resources have made it possible to fit rich, highly structured models which were previously considered intractable.

<summary>Here are some awesome resources for learning Bayesian methods.</summary>

* The **free book** _[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/)_. Made with a "computation/understanding-first, mathematics-second point of view." Uses [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc). It's available in print too!
* Like learning by playing? Me too. Try [19 Questions](https://github.com/fulldecent/19-questions), "a machine learning game which asks you questions and guesses an object you are thinking about," and **explains which Bayesian statistics techniques it's using!**
* [_Time Series Forecasting with Bayesian Modeling by Michael Grogan_](https://www.manning.com/liveprojectseries/time-series-forecasting-with-bayesian-modeling), a 5-project series - paid but the first project is free.
* [Bayesian Modelling in Python](https://github.com/markdregan/Bayesian-Modelling-in-Python). Uses [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) as well.
